Hello!

Version 3.0 is approaching release and includes significant changes to the core processing algorithm. These changes
improve consistency and fix long-standing ordering issues, but require careful review due to potential breaking changes
in specific scenarios.

## 🔄 Core Algorithm Changes Requiring Your Attention

### **Processing Order Revolution**

The most significant update: **all elements (placeholders, comments) are now processed in document order of appearance
**, rather than the previous grouped approach (comments first, then inline processors, then placeholders).

**What this means for you:**

- If you had comments and placeholders on the same lines, resolution order will change
- More predictable and intuitive processing flow
- Better support for interdependent elements

### **Custom Processor API Updates**

- **Removal of ParagraphPlaceholder injection** from custom CommentProcessor implementations
- **New hierarchical context system**: Introduction of `ContextTree` and `ContextBranch` for managing resolution
  contexts
- **Context annotation approach**: Comment and tag hooks are now annotated with descriptions of the context to use for
  resolution
- The engine automatically resolves placeholders using the appropriate context when processing elements
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### **API Cleanup**

- **All deprecated methods removed** - please check your migration path
- **Unnecessary setters eliminated** for better immutability
- Streamlined configuration API

## 🧪 Who Needs to Pay Special Attention?

### **Minimal Impact**

If you use office-stamper with standard configurations and no custom processors, you likely won't notice significant
changes beyond potential resolution order issues.

### **Critical Testing Required** If You:

- Have custom processors that relied on the placeholder resolver
- Use complex templates with comments and placeholders interacting on the same lines
- Depend on the specific processing order of v2.x

## 📋 How to Test the Preview

You can find the PR #609

**Focus your testing on:**

1. Templates with mixed comments and placeholders
2. Custom processor implementations
3. Complex SpEL expressions that might be order-dependent
4. Any edge cases in your document generation
