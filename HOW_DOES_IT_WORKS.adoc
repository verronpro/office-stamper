=== Office‑stamper: How the engine works

This document explains the runtime pipeline of the Office‑stamper engine, with a focus on how the library iterates through DOCX parts, how core concepts interact, and where you can extend or customize behavior.

The code references below point to the engine module.
Key classes:
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.DocxStamper`
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.DocxIterator`
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.Engine`
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.Hook`, `CommentHook`, `TagHook`
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.ExpressionResolver`
- `pro.verron.officestamper.core.TextualDocxPart`

'''

=== 1. High‑level architecture and flow

At a high level, stamping proceeds as follows:
1. Read or receive a `WordprocessingMLPackage` (the DOCX) and build a document model (`TextualDocxPart`).
2. Run pre‑processors (optional).
3. Iterate textual parts (document body, headers, footers) and locate processing “hooks”:
- Comment ranges (DOCX comments surrounding text to control visibility/loops)
- Smart tags with element `officestamper` (inline placeholders `${...}` and processors)
4. For each hook, build a `ProcessorContext`, prepare an `Engine`, and either:
- Evaluate and apply a comment processor (e.g., display/hide, repeat rows), or
- Resolve a placeholder and replace it with generated content.
5. When a hook makes a structural change (e.g., replacing a tag, removing a comment), restart iteration to keep traversal coherent.
6. Run post‑processors (optional) and save the document.

Relevant code path:
- `DocxStamper.stamp(InputStream|WordprocessingMLPackage, contextRoot, OutputStream)`
- `DocxStamper.process(...)` → `processPart(...)` → `processTextualPart(...)`

'''

=== 2. Core runtime components

==== 2.1 DocxStamper: Orchestration

`DocxStamper` is the main entry point that wires together evaluation, processors, and traversal.

Key responsibilities:
- Configure a per‑hook `StandardEvaluationContext` and `SpelExpressionParser`.
- Instantiate an `Engine` function (`engineFactory`) that builds `Engine` instances per `ProcessorContext`.
- Register method resolvers into the evaluation context so methods can be invoked from comments/placeholders:
- Comment processors (contextual functions like `displayParagraphIf`, `repeatTableRow`, etc.)
- Expression functions (user‑bound static function providers)
- Custom functions (`CustomFunction` implementations)
- Drive preprocessing, part processing, and postprocessing.

Code:

[source,java]
----
// DocxStamper.computeEngine(...)
var evaluationContext = new StandardEvaluationContext();
evaluationContextConfigurer.configureEvaluationContext(evaluationContext);
var expressionResolver = new ExpressionResolver(evaluationContext, expressionParser);
var objectResolvers = new ObjectResolverRegistry(resolvers);
var engine = new Engine(expressionResolver, exceptionResolver, objectResolvers);

var processors = instantiate(configurationCommentProcessors, processorContext, engine);
var processorResolvers = new Invokers(streamInvokers(processors));

evaluationContext.addMethodResolver(processorResolvers);
evaluationContext.addMethodResolver(new Invokers(streamInvokers(expressionFunctions)));
evaluationContext.addMethodResolver(new Invokers(functions.stream().map(Invokers::ofCustomFunction)));
----

Processing loop:

[source,java]
----
private void processTextualPart(DocxPart part, Object contextRoot) {
    var iterator = DocxIterator.ofHooks(part::content, part);
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        var hook = iterator.next();
        hook.ifPresent(h -> { if (h.run(engineFactory, contextRoot)) iterator.reset(); });
    }
}
----

The `iterator.reset()` is crucial: after a structural change (e.g., removing a comment or replacing a tag with generated content), we restart iteration from the beginning of that part to avoid skipping or double‑processing nodes.

==== 2.2 TextualDocxPart: Document view of textual parts

`TextualDocxPart` adapts a `WordprocessingMLPackage` and exposes a `DocxPart` facade:
- Identifies and enumerates relevant textual parts (document, headers, footers).
- Provides `content()` backed by docx4j’s `ContentAccessor` lists.
- Maintains a map of DOCX comments and their relationships (`CommentRangeStart`, `CommentRangeEnd`, `CommentReference`).
- Resolves `Comment` wrappers and paragraph anchors.

This class enables consumers to treat each textual part uniformly while hiding docx4j relationship details.

==== 2.3 DocxIterator: Structured traversal with stack expansion

`DocxIterator` is a nested iterator over DOCX content trees.
It starts from a `Supplier<Iterator<Object>>` and lazily expands when encountering container nodes.

* Containers that cause expansion include:
* `ContentAccessor` (e.g., body, paragraphs, tables, table rows, table cells)
* `SdtRun` and `SdtBlock` (structured document tags)
* `Pict` (VML pictures, inline content)
* Non‑container nodes are yielded as is.
* A LIFO queue (`ArrayDeque` wrapped with `Collections.asLifoQueue`) preserves depth‑first order.

Factory helpers in `DocxIterator` build typed iterators with mapping and filtering:
- `ofParagraphs(DocxPart)` → `StandardParagraph` abstraction over `P` and `CTSdtContentRun`
- `ofCRS(ContentAccessor)` → comment range starts - `ofRun(ContentAccessor)` → runs - `ofTags(ContentAccessor, DocxPart)` → smart tag `officestamper` → `Tag`
- `ofComments(ContentAccessor, DocxPart)` → comment lookups - `ofHooks(ContentAccessor, DocxPart)` → unified stream of `Hook` (`CommentHook` or `TagHook`) wrapped in `Optional`

The iteration model is central to how hooks are found and processed, and why we reset upon changes.

==== 2.4 Hook system: CommentHook and TagHook

Hooks are actionable items found during traversal.

* `Hook.filter(DocxPart)` returns a `Filter<Object, Optional<Hook>>` that:
* Accepts either a `CommentRangeStart` or a `CTSmartTagRun` with element `"officestamper"`.
* Maps them to the corresponding hook:
** `CommentHook` via `part.getComment(...)`
** `TagHook` wrapping a `Tag` facade over `CTSmartTagRun`

`CommentHook.run(...)`:
- Creates a `ProcessorContext` from the hosting `DocxPart`, the comment, its paragraph, and a `Placeholder` view of the comment expression.
- Invokes `Engine.process(...)` and, on success, deletes the comment artifacts from the document.

`TagHook.run(...)`:
- Interprets the tag’s `type` attribute:
- `type="processor"`: evaluate as a side‑effecting processor expression; on success, remove the tag.
- `type="placeholder"`: resolve to content (`Engine.resolve(...)`) and replace the tag with the generated `Insert`.

This duality lets you embed both imperative processors and inline placeholders as smart tags, without relying only on DOCX comments.

==== 2.5 Engine: Expression evaluation and content generation

`Engine` is the glue between expression evaluation and object resolution.

* `process(contextRoot, Placeholder)` evaluates an expression from a comment or tag (e.g., `displayParagraphIf(...)`) and lets the corresponding comment processor act via the registered `MethodResolver`.
* `resolve(DocxPart, Tag, contextRoot)` evaluates a placeholder (e.g., `${customer.name}`) and then consults `ObjectResolverRegistry` to turn arbitrary Java objects into document `Insert`s (runs, paragraphs, table rows, etc.).
* Exceptions during evaluation or resolution are handled via the configured `ExceptionResolver`.

`ExpressionResolver` uses Spring Expression Language (SpEL) with a `StandardEvaluationContext`:

[source,java]
----
evaluationContext.setRootObject(contextRoot);
var expression = parser.parseExpression(placeholder.content());
return expression.getValue(evaluationContext);
----

`ObjectResolverRegistry` (not shown here) selects an `ObjectResolver` capable of converting the evaluation result to a `Insert` (from `pro.verron.officestamper.api`).
If resolution fails, `ExceptionResolver` is invoked and a fallback textual run is inserted instead.

'''

=== 3. Concepts and how they interact

* `DocxStamper` coordinates the full lifecycle and provides the configurable evaluation context.
* `TextualDocxPart` exposes the document structure as processable parts.
* `DocxIterator` walks the content tree and yields potential `Hook`s.
* `Hook` materializes as either `CommentHook` or `TagHook`.
* Each hook constructs a `ProcessorContext` and asks `engineFactory` for an `Engine` bound to that context.
* The `Engine` evaluates expressions using SpEL and delegates to either comment processors (imperative operations) or object resolvers (content replacement).
* Structural changes cause iteration reset to ensure a consistent traversal.
'''

=== 4. What is a placeholder, tag, and comment?

* Placeholder: a template expression whose content is evaluated against the context root, often replacing inline content.
In smart tags, `type="placeholder"` marks that a tag should be replaced by the resolved value.
* Processor: a function invocation in comments or tags that changes document structure (e.g., visibility, repetition).
In smart tags, `type="processor"` marks that a tag should be executed for side effects and then removed.
* Comment: a DOCX comment block (range start/end + reference) that can contain processor expressions.
After successful processing, comments are deleted from the document.

The `Tag` adapter abstracts the inline smart tag (`CTSmartTagRun`) and provides:
- Access to the hosting paragraph - Conversion to `Comment`/`Placeholder` views - `replace(Insert)` and `remove()` operations

'''

=== 5. Extensions and configuration points

Office‑stamper is built for extension through explicit interfaces.
Most integration happens via `OfficeStamperConfiguration` passed to `DocxStamper`.

==== 5.1 Comment processors

* Purpose: Provide methods callable from SpEL expressions in comments or `type="processor"` tags.
* Registration: Map `Class<?>` → `CommentProcessorFactory`.
At runtime, `DocxStamper` calls `instantiate(...)` to build processors for the current `ProcessorContext` and `PlaceholderReplacer`.
* Invocation: Processors are exposed as method resolvers in the evaluation context, so a comment can call `displayParagraphIf(...)`, `repeatTableRow(...)`, etc.

Typical customization steps:
1. Implement `CommentProcessor` and `CommentProcessorFactory`.
2. Register via configuration: `addCommentProcessor(MyProcessor.class, MyProcessor::new)` or equivalent.
3. Use from comments: `${displayParagraphIf(customer.premium)}`.

==== 5.2 Object resolvers

* Purpose: Convert the result of a placeholder expression to DOCX content (`Insert`).
* Selection: `ObjectResolverRegistry` chooses an `ObjectResolver` based on the runtime type of the expression’s result.
* Examples: Convert `String` to a run, `List<?>` to repeated rows, a domain object to a table, etc.

Customization steps:
1. Implement `ObjectResolver` for your type(s).
2. Register in configuration via `getResolvers()`.
3. Use in placeholders: `${orderSummary}` → your resolver generates the appropriate document nodes.

==== 5.3 Expression functions and custom functions

* Expression functions: Bind arbitrary function providers to names so they can be called from SpEL (e.g., `Dates.format(...)`).
* Custom functions: Implement `CustomFunction` (adapts a `Method` into the resolver pipeline).
* Both are added as `MethodResolver`s on the evaluation context.

==== 5.4 Exception handling

* `ExceptionResolver` centralizes error handling for expression evaluation and resolution.
* On `SpelParseException`, `SpelEvaluationException`, or `OfficeStamperException`, the resolver can log, throw, or supply fallback content.

==== 5.5 Pre‑ and post‑processors

* `PreProcessor`: run before any stamping—e.g., normalize content, mutate styles.
* `PostProcessor`: run after stamping—e.g., clean artifacts, update fields, finalize layout.
* `DocxStamper.preprocess(...)` and `.postprocess(...)` iterate configured processors.

==== 5.6 Evaluation context configuration

* `EvaluationContextConfigurer` lets you pre‑configure the `StandardEvaluationContext` (e.g., property accessors, type converters, variables).
* `SpelParserConfiguration` is passed into `SpelExpressionParser` to tweak language features.
'''

=== 6. Iteration strategy in detail

The iteration strategy in `DocxIterator` is designed for nested, mixed content and safe in‑place editing.

* Start with the part’s content iterator (`ContentAccessor.getContent().iterator()`).
* Yield the first element after `unwrap(...)` (docx4j wrapper removal).
* If the element is a container (paragraph, table cell, SDT, etc.), push its child iterator onto a LIFO queue.
* Keep polling from the LIFO queue; when one iterator is exhausted, pop it and continue.
* After a structural change (e.g., replacing a tag, removing comments), client code calls `reset()` to reconstruct the traversal from the source supplier, ensuring the next pass sees the updated structure.

Why LIFO?
It yields a depth‑first traversal that behaves predictably when manipulating nested structures (e.g., SDTs inside paragraphs inside table cells).

Factory filters:
- `ofHooks(...)` uses `Hook.filter(part)` to detect either comment starts or smart tags with `element == "officestamper"`.
- `ofTags(...)` specifically targets `CTSmartTagRun` where `Hook.isTagElement(tag, "officestamper")` is true, and maps to `Tag`.
- `ofComments(...)` lines up `CommentRangeStart` nodes with `DocxPart`’s comment map to produce `Optional<Comment>` ready to be processed.

'''

=== 7. Error handling model

* Expression evaluation errors are caught at `Engine.process(...)` and `Engine.resolve(...)`.
* All SpEL parse/evaluation failures delegate to `ExceptionResolver` together with the offending `Placeholder` and an explanatory message.
* For placeholders, on failure an `Insert` is generated with fallback textual content (via `WmlFactory.newRun(resolution)`), so documents stay renderable.
'''

=== 8. Performance considerations

* Depth‑first iteration with lazy expansion avoids scanning entire subtrees until necessary.
* Iterator reset triggers a new traversal; try to keep the number of structural modifications per pass low (group operations when feasible via processors) to minimize restarts.
* Prefer resolvers that create minimal, precise nodes rather than large intermediate structures.
'''

=== 9. Usage examples (conceptual)

Resolve an inline placeholder smart tag:

[source,xml]
----
<w:smartTag w:element="officestamper">
  <!-- underlying run(s) contain placeholder text, e.g., ${customer.name} -->
</w:smartTag>
----

* `DocxIterator.ofHooks(...)` finds the `CTSmartTagRun`.
* `TagHook` reads `type="placeholder"` (if set) and calls `Engine.resolve(...)`.
* `ObjectResolverRegistry` converts the result to an `Insert` (e.g., a run) and replaces the tag.

Process a comment‑driven condition:

[source,text]
----
${displayParagraphIf(order.total > 0)}
----

* `CommentHook` builds a `ProcessorContext` and calls `Engine.process(...)`.
* The configured `CommentProcessor`’s method is invoked via SpEL; if it returns success, the hook deletes the comment.

Repeat a table row (typical processor):

[source,text]
----
${repeatTableRow(order.items)}
----

* The processor clones the current table row for each item, sets the item as iteration context, and resolves cell placeholders.
'''

=== 10. Extending the library: step‑by‑step

Add a new comment processor:
1. Create `class MyTableProcessor implements CommentProcessor` and a matching factory implementing `CommentProcessorFactory`.
2. Implement methods like `repeatCustomRows(List<MyRow> rows)` using the provided `ProcessorContext` and `PlaceholderReplacer` to resolve nested placeholders.
3. Register in `OfficeStamperConfiguration#addCommentProcessor`.
4. Use in template comments: `${repeatCustomRows(myData.rows)}`.

Add a new object resolver:
1. Implement `ObjectResolver<MyType>` that produces an `Insert` for your type.
2. Register via configuration (`getResolvers()` or equivalent builder method).
3. Use in a smart‑tag placeholder: `${myComplexObject}`.

Expose custom functions:
1. Add an entry to `expressionFunctions` mapping `MyFunctions.class` → new instance or static provider.
2. Or implement `CustomFunction` and register.
3. Call from SpEL in comments/tags: `${@MyFunctions.formatCurrency(amount)}` depending on your naming strategy.

Customize evaluation:
- Provide an `EvaluationContextConfigurer` to register variables, property accessors, or a `TypeLocator`.
- Provide a `SpelParserConfiguration` to enable/disallow features like auto‑grow lists, null references, etc.

Handle errors consistently:
- Provide an `ExceptionResolver` that logs with context and returns a safe fallback.

'''

=== 11. Design principles embodied

* Composition over inheritance: behavior is surfaced via registries and factories rather than subclassing `DocxStamper`.
* Immutability at the edges: `ProcessorContext` snapshots state; processors should behave functionally where possible.
* Clear separation of concerns:
* Traversal (`DocxIterator`)
* Detection (`Hook`/filters)
* Execution (`Engine` + processors/resolvers)
* Configuration (evaluation context, parsers, registries) '''

=== 12. Glossary

* `DocxPart`: A wrapper around a DOCX part that can be processed (document, header, footer).
* `Hook`: A processing opportunity found during traversal (comment or smart tag).
* `ProcessorContext`: Captures current part, paragraph, comment/tag, and placeholder for processor use.
* `Placeholder`: An expression holder with both raw content and compiled form.
* `Insert`: An object encapsulating new document nodes to insert (runs, paragraphs, rows).
* `CommentProcessor`: Provides callable methods to manipulate the document from SpEL expressions.
* `ObjectResolver`: Converts evaluated objects into document content.
'''

=== 13. Practical tips

* Keep expressions simple; push complexity into Java processors/functions.
* Prefer smart tags (`officestamper`) for inline placeholders and lightweight processors.
* Use comments for block‑level operations affecting paragraphs/tables.
* Test processors independently by mocking `ProcessorContext` and `PlaceholderReplacer`.
* Use pre/post‑processors for cross‑cutting concerns (styles, cleanup, fields).
'''

=== 14. Where to look in the code

* Orchestration and lifecycle: `DocxStamper`
* Evaluation and resolution: `Engine`, `ExpressionResolver`
* Iteration mechanics: `DocxIterator`
* Hook detection and dispatch: `Hook`, `CommentHook`, `TagHook`
