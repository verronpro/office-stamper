= Advanced Features

This page covers some more advanced features and techniques available in Office-stamper.

== Headers and Footers

The .docx file format doesn't permit comments within headers or footers.
Office-stamper provides a workaround for this limitation:

1. Craft the expression as you would in a comment
2. Encapsulate it with "#{}".
3. Position it at the beginning of the paragraph you want to manipulate.

Example:
[source]
----
#{displayParagraphIf(showPageNumbers)} Page ${pageNumber} of ${totalPages}
----

This allows you to conditionally display content or repeat elements in headers and footers.

== Preprocessors

Preprocessors allow you to perform operations on the document before the stamping process begins.
This can be useful for document preparation, validation, or setting up complex transformations.

[source,java]
----
void main(String[] args){
    // Create a custom preprocessor
    class CustomPreprocessor implements Preprocessor {
        @Override
        public void process(WordprocessingMLPackage document) {
            // Perform operations on the document before stamping
        }
    }

    // Add the preprocessor to the configuration
    var configuration = OfficeStamperConfigurations.standardWithPreprocessing();
    configuration.addPreprocessor(new CustomPreprocessor());
}
----

== Post Processors

Post-processors allow you to perform additional operations after the stamping process is complete.
This can be useful for cleaning up the document or adding summaries.

[source,java]
----
void main(String[] args){
    // Create a custom post processor
    class CustomPostProcessor implements PostProcessor {
        @Override
        public void process(WordprocessingMLPackage document) {
            // Perform operations on the document after stamping
        }
    }

    // Add the post-processor to the configuration
    var configuration = OfficeStamperConfigurations.standardWithPreprocessing();
    configuration.addPostProcessor(new CustomPostProcessor());
}
----

== Working with Footnotes and Endnotes

As of version 2.7.0, Office-stamper is aware of footnotes and endnotes.
With the `standardWithPreprocessing` configuration, it cleans orphaned notes automatically.

Future versions may include more comprehensive support for stamping within footnotes and endnotes.

== Handling Complex Tables

=== Dynamic Table Generation

The `resolveTable` comment processor allows you to dynamically generate tables from data:

[source]
----
resolveTable(report.dataTable)
----

Where `report.dataTable` is an instance of `StampTable` that contains:
- A list of headers for columns
– A 2-level list of rows containing values for each column.

=== Table Row Repetition

For tables with existing structure, you can use the `repeatTableRow` processor:

[source]
----
repeatTableRow(employees)
----

This will repeat the row for each item in the collection, evaluating expressions within the cells against each item.

== Document Parts

The `repeatDocPart` processor allows you to repeat more complex structures that may include multiple paragraphs, tables, or other elements:

[source]
----
repeatDocPart(chapters)
----

This is more flexible than `repeatParagraph` or `repeatTableRow` when you need to repeat larger sections of your document.

== Conditional Display

Office-stamper provides a rich set of conditional display options:

[source]
----
// Basic boolean condition
displayParagraphIf(customer.vip)
displayTableRowIf(order.items.size() > 0)
displayTableIf(report.hasData())

// Check if object is present
displayParagraphIfPresent(customer.address)
displayTableRowIfPresent(order.discounts)
displayTableIfPresent(report.data)
displayWordsIfPresent(customer.middleName)
displayDocPartIfPresent(chapter.summary)

// Check if object is absent
displayParagraphIfAbsent(customer.address)
displayTableRowIfAbsent(order.discounts)
displayTableIfAbsent(report.data)
displayWordsIfAbsent(customer.middleName)
displayDocPartIfAbsent(chapter.summary)
----

== Working with Images

Office-stamper can insert images into documents using the `Image` class:

[source,java]
----
void main(){
    // Create an image from a file
    var image = new Image(new File("path/to/image.jpg"));

    // Or from a byte array
    var image = new Image(imageByteArray);

    // Customize the image
    image.setWidth(400);  // Width in points
    image.setHeight(300); // Height in points

    // Use in your context object
    class ReportContext {
        public Image getLogo() {
            return image;
        }
    }
    // In the template: ${logo}
}
----

== Performance Considerations

For large documents or batch processing, consider the following:

1. **Reuse configuration**: create the configuration once and reuse it for multiple stamping operations.
2. **Minimize context size**: keep your context objects as small as possible.
3. **Use efficient data structures**: prefer lists to sets or maps when order matters.
4. **Consider memory usage**: for large documents, monitor memory usage and consider processing in chunks.
