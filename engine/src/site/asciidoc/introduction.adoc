= Introduction to Office-stamper

Office-stamper is a Java template engine that allows for dynamic creation of DOCX documents at runtime.
You design a template using your preferred Word processor; and Office-stamper generate documents based on that template.

== What is Office-stamper?

Office-stamper is a library that enables you to:

* Create dynamic DOCX documents from templates
* Replace placeholders with actual data
* Conditionally show or hide content
* Repeat sections based on collections of data
* Maintain the original formatting of your templates

== Key Features

* **Expression-based templating**: use Spring Expression Language (SpEL) for powerful template expressions.
* **Comment-based processing**: add special instructions as comments in your Word documents.
* **Formatting preservation**: all formatting from the original template remains.
* **Custom functions**: extend the templating capabilities with your own functions
* **Type-safe**: strong typing for Java integration
* **Flexible configuration**: customize the behavior to suit your needs
